### Inventory Adjustments
You adjust inventory in a store when the quantity of items in a location is not the same as the quantity of items recorded. This can occur for a number of reasons. For example, if products in a store are damaged, the amount of inventory available must be adjusted to reflect that situation.

Inventory Adjustments can be used to modify the value and/or quantity of stock in your business. For example, if you have just discovered that you need to change the quantity of items on hand, then this is a possible method you can explore.
