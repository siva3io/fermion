### Cycle Count
A cycle count is a perpetual inventory auditing procedure, where you follow a regularly repeated sequence of checks on a subset of inventory. Cycle counts contrast with traditional physical inventory in that a traditional physical inventory ceases operations at a facility while all items are counted.

### About Pick List
A pick list is a document sent to your warehouse pickers to fulfill a customer order. A pick list communicates the items they will need to retrieve from inventory storage, including inventory SKU, quantities and locations. As soon as a pick list is generated, the order fulfillment process can begin.
