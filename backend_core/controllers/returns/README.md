## Returns

### Sales Returns
A sales return is when a customer or client sends a product back to the seller. A customer may return an item for several reasons, including: Excess quantity: A customer may have ordered more items than they need, or a company may have accidentally sent additional products.

### Purchase Returns
A purchase return is when a buyer (either a business or an individual) returns goods that they bought to the seller for a refund or store credit, depending on the seller's policy. The buyer might make these returns for various reasons, as long as they align with local laws and the seller's return policy.
